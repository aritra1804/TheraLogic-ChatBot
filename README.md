## ‚ö° Setup & Usage

### 1. Backend (Flask + Ollama)

1. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   python backend.py
   ```
   - The backend runs on `http://localhost:5050` by default.
   - Make sure Ollama is running locally with your chosen model (e.g., `ollama run llama3`)

   ```bash
   cd theralogic-frontend
   npm install
   ```

   ```
   - The frontend runs on `http://localhost:3000`

## üß† How It Works

- **Message Flow:**
  1. User sends a message in chat.
  2. Backend classifies it as "emotional" or "logical" using an LLM.
  3. The message is routed to either a therapist-style or logical agent.
  4. The response is returned and can be saved as a journal entry.

- **Journaling:**
  - All journal entries are stored in your browser (localStorage).
  - The Journal page lets you view, edit, and search your entries.

- **Onboarding:**
  - New users see a onboarding tour on first visit.
